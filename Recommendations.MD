# 🦈 Shark Tank India: Deal Dynamics & Investment Trends

This project explores the entrepreneurial, financial, and investor behavior patterns in the Indian version of Shark Tank. Using Python for data preprocessing and analysis, and Tableau for dynamic dashboards, we investigate what makes a pitch successful, how different investors behave, and which industries attract more funding.
